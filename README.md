# Customer Segmentation for a Retail Store

## Overview

This project is part of my Data Science journey with the Digital Empowerment Pakistan (July Batch 1) program. The objective of this task is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using transaction data. This segmentation helps in targeted marketing strategies, personalized promotions, and improving customer retention.

## Introduction

In this project, we analyze historical sales data to identify distinct groups of customers using clustering techniques. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying clustering algorithms to segment customers.

## Dataset

The dataset contains transaction data with the following columns:
- Date
- Mode
- Category
- Subcategory
- Note
- Amount
- Income/Expense
- Currency

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and data types.
   - Create relevant features such as total purchase amount, purchase frequency, and recency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand data distribution and relationships.

3. **Clustering Algorithms**:
   - Normalize the data.
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
   - Apply K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers.

4. **Visualization of Customer Segments**:
   - Visualize clusters to interpret and profile the customer segments.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
